# User data analysis for Eigenleben
This was for a very small, funded social network called Eigenleben that resides on Facebook's Workplace. In order to prolong the funding DSSG was asked to first brainstorm on how the data can be gathered and analyzed, and then to implement some key points of the analysis.  
My part was a user analysis, which was basically scraping and plotting data.
